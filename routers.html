4.The encryption method secures data between your computers and the Wireless Gateway. The default 
setting, WPAWPA2-PSK (TKIP/AES), is compatible with most computers and provides the best security
and performance

I think that I have made good changes for the network. This is the first year that my roommates and I have used this comcast router but IÕm pretty sure its instated as their router now. I trust the standards that comcast keeps seeing as they are an authority in cable and internet. The password is one that comes with the router and is super unique as well.

I have learned the different specs about routers in general. I have learned about the standards for security that different companies use to support the routers that they sell.
