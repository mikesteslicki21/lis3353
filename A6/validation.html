<p> revising and checking all of the html and css code is no easy process. In involves loading and reloading the data over and over again, and if you are not patient you can get really irritated. it becomes all worth it in the end though when you finally get your page to work in spite of all of the validation standards and such. Id say this is an interesting way to learn something for the first time. The more time you spend working to perfect something the first time you do it, the more lasting effect you are going to get from your effort. First impressions are everything and that is even true of learning.

At first I was a little mixed up as far as how the organization of the header tags in relation to the div tags worked, but most of my errors were In this vein. I learned some of the different instances in which you would use a /> tag rather than a > tag to close certain elements also. I had some redundant code left over from a table code that I had gotten from the internet and cleaning that up wasn't too hard. 

I'd say that a working knowledge of css and html is certainly a foundation for anyone looking to break into the field of technology. The world is undergoing a transitional period in which all of the information that we already have is being represented in some way on the net.

I also think that css is really an art. There are many different factors to consider when building a webpage to further ease the decision making process of the end user. That, along with an appealing mix of coloring, animations, anything to make the webpage stand out.</p>
