    Hey my name is Eugene but I go by Mike and
    I'd like to think that I'm a pretty cool guy.
    I'm the oldest of 6 children and I love all of
    my siblings very much. I think it's funny how a decent
    amount of republicans don't know that Steven Colbert is
    kidding all of the time (because apparently he's a sunday school teacher),
    but my dad was a republican so I'm pretty sure that I'm kinda republican.
    If you've never heard of the Strokes there's a strong decrease in our
    overall freindship probability. I like fine wine and sunsets on the beach,
    followed by a nice jet ski ride in the dark.

  <td>Refers to the condition of a disk or of RAM in which files are divided into pieces scattered around the disk or broken up in memory. Fragmentation occurs naturally when you use a disk to frequently create, delete, and modify files. Utilities exist, both built-in to many operating systems and by third parties, to defragment disks and files, but are less necessary for some newer operating systems that use techniques to reduce fragmentation or automatically defragment in the </td>
